# Introduction

## Getting started

This guide details the process of setting up a Bloxberg validator node using a Docker image.

Validator nodes play a crucial role in the Bloxberg blockchain by verifying transactions and contributing to the consensus mechanism.

## System Requirements

- Operating System: Ubuntu 22.04 or later (Other OSes may be compatible with adjustments)
- CPU: Minimum 4 cores
- RAM: Minimum 4GB
- Storage: Recommended 250GB SSD (more for futureproofing)
- Firewall: Port 30303 open for communication with other nodes
- CPU Instruction Set: AES support (verify with cat /proc/cpuinfo for "aes" in flags)

## Steps

### Clone the Repository

- Access the server where you'll host the validator node.
- Utilize a Git client to clone the bloxberg-validator-node repository.

### Configure the Validator

- Edit the docker-compose.yml file with a text editor (e.g., nano or vim).
- Locate the NAT_IP variable and replace it with your server's external IP address.
- Save the changes.

### Set Validator Password

- Navigate to the src/validator-data directory.
- Open the validator.pwd file using a text editor.
- Create a strong password to encrypt your private key.
- Save the password securely.

### Initial Setup

- Navigate to the src/ directory.
- Execute the script with the command `sudo ./setup.sh.`

### Start the Validator

- Return to the repository root directory.
- Run the command `sudo docker-compose up` in the terminal.
- This will take some time and initiates the Docker container and generates an Authority Address.

### Register with Bloxberg Association

- Copy the Authority Address obtained in the previous step.
- Provide this address to the Bloxberg Association for registration purposes.

### Run the Validator in Background

- Terminate the currently running container by pressing Ctrl+C.
- To execute the validator in the background, use the command `docker-compose up -d`

## Important Notes

- The specified system requirements represent minimums. Allocate more resources for optimal performance and stability
- Ports 8545 (JSON-RPC API) and 8546 (Web-Socket) are used for local interaction with the blockchain and do not necessitate internet exposure
- This guide assumes familiarity with working on the command line and editing text files
